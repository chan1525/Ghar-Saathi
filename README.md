## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application follows a classic client-server model. The React single-page application (SPA) communicates with the Node.js/Express backend via a REST API.

The most interesting architectural decision is the dual-strategy approach to location-based searches:

1.  **Pre-computation for Speed**: For categories like laborers and materials, the system performs a one-time, heavy calculation during user signup to determine the user's closest cities. Future queries for these categories are then extremely fast, as they just retrieve from this pre-computed list.
2.  **Real-time for Precision**: For sites and buildings, where exact distance matters most, the system calculates the point-to-point driving distance in real-time for every request, ensuring maximum accuracy at the cost of slower response times.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js and npm
* PostgreSQL installed and running
* A free API key from [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ghar-saathi.git](https://github.com/your-username/ghar-saathi.git)
    cd ghar-saathi
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup Backend:**
    * Navigate to the directory containing `server.js`.
    * Create a `.env` file and add your database credentials and API key:
        ```env
        DB_USER=postgres
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_DATABASE=gharsati
        DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
        DB_PORT=5432
        GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_geoapify_api_key
        ```
    * *Note: You will need to update `server.js` to use these environment variables instead of the hardcoded values.*

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * **Start the Backend Server:**
        ```bash
        node server.js
        ```
    * **Start the Frontend React App:**
